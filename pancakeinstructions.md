The goal of this project:

1. Read the desired\_receipt.txt. This is the receipt content that we want to print. 
2. Design a json schema that can represent the content in sample.txt.
3. Design a drag and drop builder that can build a receipt with the given features.
4. Write a kotlin script that reads the json and calls the relevant functions to make the Epson printer calls (see printerapi.md)
